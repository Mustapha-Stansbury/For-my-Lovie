<h2> May 2023 </h2>
<p>May was the special month we met around this time I was very lost. I was still healing from past situations and was searching for something true and genuine and God answered my prayers may 20th 2023. These pictures are from the month of may our first and second date which are very special to me especially the first date. From the start our personalities clicked everything felt so natural, I was definitely crushing HARD.            


<p>                                                                  Meeting you was the best gift the universe could ever give. It provided me with a person my soul could belong to. And nothing will ever make me feel so special-Anonymous

<h2> June 2023</h2>

<p>It is now June we've been talking for a month now getting to know eachother more and more spending more time with one another. We were so delusional over each other its so funny lol, like you were really all mine and I was so delusional over you:this was also the month we met eachothers family. June was extremly eventful lol; our picnic date,scotts run,that random party out clinton,and many more memories. I was so excited for what God had in store for us, this month I knew you were the one.

<h2> July 2023</h2>
<div>
    <p> July another eventful month, around this time we were progressing fast like we were really locked in fr both of us knew what it is was. This the month of pink tape too, we were cranking hella. Things were getting serious at the right pace,and I was ready for all of it. This was a exciting month a lot happened; this month we made the jars and you almost made a real one cry. We also went to the beach, and the wharf.

    <h2> August 2023</h2>
    <div>
        <p> This was a sad month for me I was so anxious about us leaving for college but you constantly reassured me that we would be okay. We spent so much time together just doing anything. I was always over your house I know Mrs.Angela and Mr.darius were tired of me lol. I feel like last month and this month were when we started connecting on a deeper level, emotions , way of thinking, traumas, insecurities etc. Through the adjusting to each other and the headbutting I really feel like it brought us closer, showing me your true self made me want to understand your 10x more, I wanted to be able to take care of you and your heart and show you genuine love.
